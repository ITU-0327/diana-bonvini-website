    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="about-content">
        <p>
            I am passionate about researching and writing important ideas and stories that need to be told. With over two
            decades of experience in writing and editing for media, government and not for profit organisations, I help
            unique stories and truths come to life. I support my freelance writing by undertaking roles in office and
            operational administration where I can contribute my experience and skills to high performing teams.
        </p>

        <p>
            As an office manager, I value systems and processes that improve productivity and sustainability in the
            workplace. I enjoy taking the lead on office improvement projects and executing on the team's ideas to
            streamline operations, particularly during times of change. I am renowned for my meticulous attention to detail,
            reliability, and consistency in delivering solutions and results that exceed my team's expectations.
        </p>

        <p>
            With my versatile work style, and years of experience across a range of industries, I am role ready from day one
            to add value and contribute positively to the culture in any organisation.
